### Engineering Job Challenge

[Discord](https://jetkvm.com/discord) | [Website](https://jetkvm.com) | [Docs](https://jetkvm.com/docs)

</div>
Welcome to the Engineering Job Challenge! ðŸš€
</br></br>

This is a practical exercise designed to give you a feel for the kind of problems we solve at JetKVM. **Pick one or more challenges, implement your solution in the relevant repos, and send us your patch sets.** Your submission should demonstrate not only that it works, but also clean code, thoughtful design, and a good developer experience.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deadline for this job challenge is 23 September, 2025 - 23:59 UTC.

## How to Participate
1. **Clone the repos you need** for the challenge (e.g. kvm, api). Keep private until deadline.
2. **Implement challenges** using the pre-defined challenge branch name

Once you're ready with all the challenges you wanted to implement:
1. **Create a patchset** for each challenge & repo

```bash
git fetch --all --tags
git format-patch \
--base=challenge-base \
challenge-base...<your-challenge-branch> \
-o ~/jetkvm-challenges/<your-challenge-branch>/<repo-name>
```

2. **Package your work**

Zip the whole `~/jetkvm-challenges` directory. It should looks something like:

```
jetkvm-challenges/
  automated-e2e-test-suite/
    kvm/
      0001-add-tests.patch
    api/
      0001-new-endpoint.patch
  h265/
    kvm/
      0001-add-h265-support.patch
```


3. **Email us the challenges**
   - **To:** `jobs [at] jetkvm [dot] com`
   - **Subject:** `JetKVM Engineering Job Challenge`
   - **Body**: Anything youâ€™d like us to know about your solution (e.g. notes, assumptions, trade-offs).
   - **Attachment**: One zip of the `jetkvm-challenges` directory with all the folders & `.patch` files in it.

## Use of AI Tools

You are welcome to use AI tools while working on this challenge. This reflects how we work day-to-day at JetKVM: AI can speed things up, but itâ€™s not a substitute for thoughtful engineering.
What matters is that you **fully understand the code you submit and could explain it if asked.**
